4. Run the following commands to add Predictions resources to the project. Check [this guide](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/predictions/label-image/q/platform/android/) for reference.

```
$ amplify add predictions

? Please select from one of the categories below (Use arrow keys)
  `Identify`
? What would you like to identify? (Use arrow keys)
  `Identify Labels`
? Provide a friendly name for your resource
  `labelObjects`
? Would you like use the default configuration? (Use arrow keys)
  `Default Configuration`
? Who should have access? (Use arrow keys)
  `Auth and Guest users`
```
5. Run `amplify push` to push changes and provision backend resources on AWS.

6. You will most likely get errors. To fix these, find all `parameters.json` files in the `amplify` directory, and add the following to the JSON.
```
"access": "auth",
"type": "ALL"
```

7. Rerun the `amplify push` command.

8. Go to your AWS console, and open `IAM`. Click `Roles` on the sidebar. Find the role that looks similar to `amplify-peoplecounter-dev-170738-unauthRole`. It should start with `amplify`, include the project name, and end with `unauthRole`.

9. Add the `AmazonRekognitionFullAccess` permission policy to this role.

10. You can now run the app within Android Studio with access to AWS Rekognition.
